### Why wordsApp? What's it for?

Something simple and intuitive that helps to learn foreign languages with a built-in search input connected with a dictionary API.

#### A list of supported language codes:

| Language Code | Language             |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| en_US         | English (US)         |
| hi            | Hindi                |
| es            | Spanish              |
| fr            | French               |
| ja            | Japanese             |
| ru            | Russian              |
| en_GB         | English (UK)         |
| de            | German               |

| pt-BR         | Brazilian Portuguese |
| ar            | Arabic               |
| tr            | Turkish              |

For now, WordsApp used only the English (US) language. In the future, I will add a search option with all of them.

It started as a vanilla JS with a Model View Controller architecture.

No accounts necessary and the source isn't too hard to grasp making it rather easy to extend and customise.

### Who's it for?

wordsApp is for people like me who prefers writing notes by keyboard rather than by pen. It takes less time and if you want wordsApp easily prints your words on paper.
